In the past, they use a mural, painting. After the Industrial Revolution, they use photography, the sound record. Through the improvement of the Technology, the way people preserve memory changed too.<br>Time Capsule is also a way to preserve memory. People write what they want to say to their future- self in a paper, put the paper into a bottle and buried it. After 10 years, they go back to dig it out to see what 10-year-ago’s themselves want to tell themselves in the future. Time changes everything, also change a person. Sometimes we want to go back to the past and talks to ourselves. What did we change through the time flies? Sometime we can't remember what is the most important thing for us 10 years ago. And sometimes we deserve to have a conversation with ourselves in the past.<br>",

Maybe cool, be dangerous, be marvelous, but it can also be friendly, and cute. Like Doraemon.<br>Alan Turing said that he design a machine like a child, not an adult. He also argued that it might be good if his child computer acted randomly, at least some of that time.<br> Take it easy, and make everything possible. that’s what my project want to achieve. <br>This newspaper is written by my little AI journalist. Like most of three year old children, it read lot’s of fairytale and children’s books. Such like Grimm, one thousand and one night, also fairytale from japan, brazil. It will keep on reading lot’s fairytale. It is going to discover the world through its tiny digital eyes, and share with people what it saw in the newspaper and website.<br><br>reference:<br>In the machine learning part, I use the \"Story teller\" by Ryan Kiros<br>https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller<br>",

		"description": "Shan shui painting, refers to a style of traditional Chinese painting that involves or depicts scenery or natural landscapes, using a brush and ink rather than more conventional paints. In Chinese, “Shan” is mountain and “Shui” is water, but the two elements together signify a landscape. When Chinese painters work on shan shui painting, they do not try to present an image of what they have seen in the nature, but what they have thought about nature.<br><br>Chinese Shan shui painting was brought to Taiwan with a plenty of immigrants, just like other immigrant culture, after thee generations, new generations began to reflect on the relationship between original culture and themselves.<br><br>Through this project, I began to think what is the nature of Taiwan in my mind. Taiwan is a island which full of mountain and rain. In my hometown, the best time to see the mountain after raining days. In this time, there are no impurities but some steam in the air, the shape of mountains are clear but soft. It feel like a landscape with stretched mountains which made by rain.<br><br>In oder to reproduce the image, I made a installation to create mountains by rain. In the upside of five acrylic plates are five tube. The whole installation connect to the weather of Taiwan’s five longitudinal mountain ranges. Each tube represent a mountain from north to south. If the mountain is raining, the tube will begin to supply ink, when ink drop down into the gap between five acrylic plate, it create the shape of mountains.<br>",

I have none connection of it.<br>I don’t know why and it bothered for a while. So I decide to create a connection between me and the portrait.<br>In this work, the characters of the portrait will gradually imitate the facial features and expressions of the viewer. In these changes, the viewer's facial expression will also be affected, then the portrait will change again. In this forth to back watching and changing, a slow and silent dialogue is formed.",

		"description": "Internet not only reduces distance of people, but polarize people. Such like google, which can filter what they don’t want to see and take priority to show what they prefer. People are effected by environment and website they search. Google and Yahoo draw on a user’s past search preferences when responding to queries, meaning that over time different people might receive ideologically opposite search results having entered identical information. And some neutral will be effected by environment and website they see. People only connect to other with the same opinion, it’s called \"echo chambers.\"<br>Every group collect proof to show they are right, but when they can’t find anything to show off, they \"MAKE\" proofs. But when the FAKE proofs come, people can’t make sure the truth in ”echo chambers”. As we have so much information in Internet, we only can get half by \"echo chambers\" and keep getting similar message just like in a loop.<br>In this work, I took massages include the letters \"mob\" or \"tyranny\" in a box. But when people look inside the box from left, they only can see the massage about \"mob\". For the same way, when people look inside the box from right, they only can see the massage about \"tyranny.\" Moreover, when they walk closer to read the massage, this massage disappeared. The only thing they can see is \"mod\" or \"tyranny.\"",

		"description": "When someone wrote \"I am happy\" on the community website, the community accepted \"happy\" but replaced \"I\" with \"you\".Then \"You are happy\" becoming a mind of this community. But in this Community, the word \"you\" in the sentence \"you are happy\" can't be defined to any single person. \"You\" can be the addresser; addressee or anyone exists inside or outside of the community. Now, if we rearrange the words of writer – \"You are happy\", \"I am happy\", \"You are not happy\", \"I am not happy\" – they don't violate the writer's original idea, and it also doesn't match the writer's idea form the beginning. However, it can stand for the community's mind. Therefore, when a person fits into a community, the community can make his/her words more powerful; on the other side, the community also weakens one's willing at the same time. In this work, I tried to use two opposite words for the community to choose. The mostly used can stand for the will of the community. In this case, I quoted a poem about \"beauty\", which full of beautiful and gentle words, written by English poet Byron after he met Mrs. Horton in a party. I pick up the adjectives about beauty, and choose opposite words, then count the statue on twitter with these words. And it will show the community's willing of \"beauty\" or \"ugliness\".",
